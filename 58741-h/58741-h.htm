  THE HOUSE OF SLEEP<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
  It is a house with many doors,<br />
  no two alike.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I am at home in all its rooms<br />
  of time and place.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  My changing person, gender, speech<br />
  hold no surprise.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I know who I am in my sleep,<br />
  behind my face.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  If you ask which of them is false<br />
  and which is true<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Enter the house with me and call,<br />
  I'll answer you.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
  Here inside the darkness,<br />
  the eye of light opens<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  As mind travels inward<br />
  to a fourth dimension.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  There is no perspective<br />
  of other or outside.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Both obverse and reverse<br />
  are simultaneous<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  While past and present form<br />
  a folding wave that flows<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Now backward, then forward<br />
  in one eternal dream.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
  I found it as a child,<br />
  a house that was all mine<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Where I could think and be<br />
  whatever I believed.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Half of me stayed outside<br />
  on guard, aware of spies<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The inner self went free<br />
  to wonder as it pleased.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Leaving the day behind,<br />
  I came upon the night<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And there I dreamed of things<br />
  past all imagining.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
  Memory is no stranger<br />
  in the house of sleep.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  It comes as a visitor<br />
  for a reunion.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  If a private occasion,<br />
  with the family<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Or else with those forgotten<br />
  who have long been gone.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The waiting house is ready<br />
  for us to gather.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Together or separately<br />
  our memories meet.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
  Waking in the night,<br />
  I have wondered where I am<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Knowing I have been away<br />
  and not yet returned.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I lie still and wait<br />
  between absence and presence<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Conscious of being witness<br />
  to my sleep and wake.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Here's body, inert,<br />
  prepared to revert to clay.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  O wanderer with my lamp,<br />
  how dim grows the light.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
  Flying effortlessly<br />
  I escape gravity<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And seaborne, breathe through gills<br />
  to swim past coral isles<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Where I emerge on shores<br />
  that climb up ancient roads.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Always, my origins<br />
  enact some past within<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Recalling elements<br />
  of former existence.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Save two, that I renounce:<br />
  bloodrust fire, fleshtorn ground.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
  Here I need no clock<br />
  to tell me what time it is.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The day, season, year<br />
  conform to no calendar.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  No compass or map<br />
  points my route or direction.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Sensation is all:<br />
  the shape and sound of feeling.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I learn what I think<br />
  by choice of symbols, meanings.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I invent my world<br />
  as much as it invents me.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
  A baton like a pendulum<br />
  swings back and forth.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Across the universe it moves<br />
  in perfect time<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Leading an orchestra of stars<br />
  through measured space.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  A score arranged with such grandeur,<br />
  I merely hear<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Its echoes through the walls of sleep&mdash;<br />
  how faint, how far<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  While my heart beats to the rhythm<br />
  of earth's passage.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
  The twelve hours of the night<br />
  are paths between the stars.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Whichever one you take<br />
  leads to this centered house<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  If you speak the password<br />
  to those who guard the gates.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  You must not look at them<br />
  or touch them on the way<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Lest you be left alone<br />
  and hear the triple bark.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  For the rest, safe journey<br />
  and sweet dreams until dawn.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap10"></a></p>

<p class="poem">
  How the bedtime refrain still echoes<br />
  through the house:<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Good night, sweet dreams, see you tomorrow."<br />
  Was it wish<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Or something more substantial for child<br />
  to sleep on<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Like a pillow filled throughout the night<br />
  with promise?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Which was kept and shall be kept in years<br />
  yet to come<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  When all the yesterdays that made me,<br />
  wake at dawn.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
  In genesis the dream began<br />
  and came to life<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  By dividing the form from void,<br />
  the dark from light<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And parting the sea from dry land,<br />
  mother from child<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Gave image its own reflection<br />
  by day and night<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  But kept the sleeping and waking<br />
  for seem and like<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  That the timeless and undying<br />
  remain in-sight.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
  Our dreamscape is a Mil Cumbres<br />
  across the years.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Peak after peak they rise like crests<br />
  above a sea<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  In which we plunge, swim, dive and drown<br />
  beneath each wave.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Yet breath returns and eyes grow clear<br />
  from time to time<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  As all stands still, becalmed, at rest,<br />
  and we can see<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  There, where we were.  Here, where we are.<br />
  How far.  Which way.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
  It was a garden of people<br />
  at all seasons.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I saw hands at work everywhere,<br />
  none of them still.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Some were planting new souls<br />
  in the fresh earth.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Others went about the weeding,<br />
  pruning, hoeing<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Their baskets filled with human plants<br />
  of every kind.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  While leaves, endless leaves kept falling<br />
  all around me.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
  Among the Joshua trees,<br />
  I saw a stone cross<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Both claiming world salvation<br />
  from brush, sand and thorn<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  While I stood on a mountain,<br />
  waiting for the ark<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  To save me from destruction,<br />
  drowned by floods of sun.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  But the fiery waves rose up<br />
  forty days and nights<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And there was not a sign of<br />
  clouds, and no dove came.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
  A bird stopped me<br />
  as I started to walk across.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "You can not enter the circle,<br />
  you have no wings."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  So I went back<br />
  and I looked for them on the earth.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  But none of all the winged insects<br />
  knew where mine were.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  So I went on<br />
  and I looked for them in the sea.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And the fish told me of angels<br />
  who looked like birds.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
  With this ring I thee wed,<br />
  said the moon, said the earth.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I saw it overhead,<br />
  a crystal band of ice<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Through which the eye of God<br />
  bore witness once again<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  To living light and love<br />
  within the cosmic void.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I heard the vows exchanged<br />
  between the cold and dark<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Then with my own, warm breath<br />
  I wed the night and slept.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
  Through the mirror and through the fog,<br />
  all things reverse.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I see the right side on the left,<br />
  the left side, right.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I see the shapes of what has been<br />
  behind, transposed.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  A camera floats above my head<br />
  as dreams submerge.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  A shadow moves beyond my feet<br />
  in backward stride.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The mirror and the fog are one,<br />
  and I, enclosed.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
  What was the Eskimo<br />
  doing in the tropics?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  What was the Hottentot<br />
  doing in the arctic?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Caught between the two,<br />
  I asked what choice was mine?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Having to freeze or burn,<br />
  I felt, was too extreme.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Yet heart elected south<br />
  and brain elected north<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Since a temperate zone<br />
  in heaven was no more.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
  I wanted to lift<br />
  the poor and ignorant soul<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  To feed and clothe it,<br />
  to give it eyes and ears.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I led it away<br />
  from hunger, cold and terror<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Helping it to climb,<br />
  to trust my choice of freedom.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  But when I let go,<br />
  the peak opened with wide jaws<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  For the slip, the fall&mdash;<br />
  and I grabbed the soul, and ran.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap20"></a></p>

<p class="poem">
  What shall I be,<br />
  I asked of Tarot cards and stars<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  That I might live<br />
  as fits my tastes, beliefs and cares?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  First, be a prince,<br />
  with pleasures, treasures, all desires.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Then, be a priest,<br />

  It looked like a mountain<br />

</p>

<p class="poem">
  A holiday setting<br />
  and dazzling in sunshine<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Where one could be at ease<br />
  to stroll and meet old friends<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Exploring all the paths<br />
  unhurried by the years<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Feeling the light within<br />
  increase with heightened joy<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  While going up and on<br />
  from terrace to terrace.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
  I went down<br />
  into the vaults of time's library<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Down through sunless, airless corridors<br />
  staffed by ghosts.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Down the winding halls and cobbled stairs<br />
  daubed with earth<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Past the rows<br />
  of book graves in a cemetery<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Of old words,<br />
  until I came to the last, first one<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  When I heard a rumble, saw a flash<br />
  and woke dumb.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
  I followed God<br />
  until he stopped at a crossroads.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  On the one side<br />
  was a cliff high above the sea.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  On the other,<br />
  a dense woods baited with summer.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Future unknown,<br />
  I asked which way was I to go?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  He pointed left,<br />
  where the sun bowed low in the west.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And God, I asked?<br />
  To the right, he said and vanished.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
  It was a long road through a fog<br />
  that swirled like clouds<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And many were going with me,<br />
  behind, ahead<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Though no one spoke or stopped, moved past<br />
  or turned aside.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  But when we reached the edge of time,<br />
  I grew afraid<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Until one found me there and smiled<br />
  and took my hand<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Then led me step by step again,<br />
  a little child.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
  First, the night came to me<br />
  in the shape of a moth.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  With a soft flick like breath,<br />
  its wing-tips grazed my head.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Then, from a hollow tree,<br />
  a hoot owl mourned its cry<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And as I turned to look,<br />
  I thought the moon turned, too.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Beyond the road, a skunk.<br />
  Within my room, a rose.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  So I sat up, I think,<br />
  while the night spoke and spoke.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
  I hear the word incessantly<br />
  as a chorus<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  A word whose voices are composed<br />
  of all my years<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Like a requiem long rehearsed<br />
  in every key<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And begun the day of my birth,<br />
  inside of me<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  A word sung for my soul's repose<br />
  while I am here<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  An earthling, bent on a journey<br />
  still amorphous.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
  How to find the way back<br />
  by subway, streetcar, bus...<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Can a hill disappear<br />
  or the stream in a park?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The morning's scent of rolls,<br />
  the sound of skates at dusk<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Laundry roofs, coalbin chutes,<br />
  wagons, carts, iron stoops...<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Like footprints in the snow,<br />
  the memories fall and drift.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I walk, I look, I ask,<br />
  a shadow in the past.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
  I ran to say goodbye<br />
  to the last railway train<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Whose old, musty freight cars<br />
  were creaking at the joints.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  In it, tons of paper,<br />
  unpublished manuscripts<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Heading for the graveyard<br />
  like passengers turned ghosts.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  At the rear, an organ,<br />
  installed in the caboose<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Began the slow, slow march,<br />
  while the wind mourned and blew.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
  O most blessed and damned of women,<br />
  so greatly loved!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I know by my dreams that your own<br />
  have never died.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Before there was Egypt or Troy,<br />
  you were a slave.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Before Tristram or Abelard,<br />
  your face was pale.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  While poets made heaven and hell<br />
  to prove your charms<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Your passion, beauty, grief and joy<br />
  slept in my arms.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap30"></a></p>

<p class="poem">
  With all that space to explore,<br />
  how could I resist?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Finding my own place out there,<br />
  the wonder of it!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  A stretched canvas came in view,<br />
  linen, framed in gold<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  With a palette never used,<br />
  meant for me alone.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I dipped my brush and painted<br />
  the place I loved best<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Then forever set my claim:<br />
  north, south, east and west.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
  I had to go on and on,<br />
  the search was not done.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Winding corridors,<br />
  walls leading from door to door.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Mice, lions, sheep, chickens, frogs,<br />
  unassorted odds.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Nothing suited&mdash;quite&mdash;<br />
  despite the resemblances.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I heard voices, laughter, groans,<br />
  sounds foreign to mine.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Mirrors, symbols, signs...<br />
  twice, I almost found myself.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
  The room was full of eyes,<br />
  whichever way I looked.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Over walls, ceiling, floor,<br />
  they darted back and forth<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Their eyelash hands and feet<br />
  mocking me and my book.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "You can not get away,<br />
  I've told you that before."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Daddy longlegs reaching,<br />
  still haunting, still speaking.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "A spider ghost, you say?<br />
  The harvest comes, daughter."<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
  They tossed the pillow<br />
  from one hand to the other.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  With roars of laughter,<br />
  it zipped, it flew, was caught and thrown.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  My seams ripped open,<br />
  scattering my heart outside.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Slowly, painfully,<br />
  I gathered it together<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And lay down to sleep,<br />
  clutching my life, my pillow.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Feathers of dead birds,<br />
  sterile echoes of lost flights.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
  A bill collector appeared,<br />
  flourishing old bills.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Your father gone, and mother,<br />
  who will pay for these?"<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I turned to the telephone,<br />
  one disconnected.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I looked inside the mailbox,<br />
  full of dead letters.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I searched through files and desk drawers,<br />
  all bankbooks cancelled.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Only one thing left to do&mdash;<br />
  to wake, and escape.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
  It was a lettuce morning,<br />
  crisp in pale sunlight.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  By noon it was canary,<br />
  cat's eye and corn grain.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  As shadows crept through the hills,<br />
  the sea turned bilious.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Dusk spilled a goodbye tunnel<br />
  down a shifting sky.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Then driftwood, fuming the air<br />
  with its smoke and cough.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  After night crashed, we picked up<br />
  plans for tomorrow.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
  When will the words be opened<br />
  and the book unsealed?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Not till the time of the end<br />
  of empires and beasts.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Then will the dream be written<br />
  according to men?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Not till the signs and vision<br />
  have become as one.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  How shall we learn to know them<br />
  as true evidence?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Not till all human senses<br />
  merge with light again.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
  They were gone for days,<br />
  the hunters and fishermen<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Challenging the beasts<br />
  who claimed the land and the sea.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The young sang their praise<br />
  all through the gloried summer<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  While the women danced<br />
  and gave them welcoming feasts.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  How their deeds warmed us<br />
  winter nights! how bright the blaze!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Now, we are fearful<br />
  and cold.  We need more old men.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
  I turned back<br />
  the thick, heavy calendar of years<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Laboring,<br />
  page by century by page of scroll<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  To restore<br />
  the undiscovered new world once more<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Hoping to<br />
  reverse the winds and tides, west to east<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  To exchange<br />
  the ships, the crews, the conquests and all.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  But gained what<br />
  by throwing Columbus overboard?<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
  Shakespeare and Cervantes<br />
  died the same day and year.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  So too Diogenes<br />
  and Great Alexander<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Although each said farewell<br />
  in places far apart.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  What extinguished both flames<br />
  at one instant of time?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  A whirlwind in the night<br />
  or a merciful rain?<br />

<p class="poem">
  May a storm at my death<br />
  help me find my partner.<br />

<p class="poem">
  All of us who saw it from the ground<br />
  testified<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  It was the tortoise that fell and killed<br />
  Aeschylus.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  So Christ, Socrates, Galileo<br />
  were killed, too.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  We, the groundlings who witnessed their deaths,<br />
  swear to you<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  It was the tortoise each time.  It fell<br />
  from the air.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Some say eagles, by letting them fall.<br />
  But who knows?<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
  I watched his clay flesh<br />
  take its changing form from thought<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And fling the fiction<br />
  of his birth-by-chance to scorn.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Science, he would say,<br />
  is another way of life...<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Without a flutter<br />
  or doubt to betray his eyes.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Such utter belief,<br />
  I found it hard to resist<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Suspending my own&mdash;<br />
  he holds his world with such ease.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
  Then she who had been my wise teacher<br />
  in the past<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Came and stood at the foot of my bed,<br />
  calling, "Child...<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I have come to say goodbye to you<br />
  at long last<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  For I join The Great Intelligence<br />
  this same night<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  There, where the substance of all shadows<br />
  is pure light..."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Which vanished, as I wept in the dark,<br />
  blind and wild.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
  Not too much light left,<br />
  I collect the candle's tears.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Prodigal before<br />
  of the sun and its seasons<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Now I search the night<br />
  for glowworms or gleams of snow.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Asleep open-eyed,<br />
  I turn my wax world slowly<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Around a lifetime<br />
  of continents and oceans<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Till the last star shrinks,<br />
  then shudders, and then goes out.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
  I saw it emptied<br />
  room by room and piece by piece<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Until the house stood vacant<br />
  of all but its bones.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  No paintings, no books,<br />
  no flowers, fruits or music.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  A silence anonymous<br />

  "Wait," my body cried,<br />

<p class="poem">
  "The owner left a message:<br />

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
  Because I longed<br />
  to comprehend the infinite<br />

  between the known and unknown<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  From zero base<br />
  to its apex point opposite<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Thus dividing<br />
  all past time from all future time<br />

<p class="poem">
  And all of space,<br />
  the positive from negative.<br />

<p class="poem">
  Where both sides met,<br />

  Proclaiming the kingdom of men<br />

  Who gave each day its daily bread,<br />

  That none be tempted to trespass<br />

  The sign said City of Dogs<br />

<p class="poem">
  Posted German Shepherd guards<br />

  Seen from afar,<br />
  the fires, riots, car wrecks, brawls<br />

ABOUT THE AUTHOR
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Elizabeth Bartlett (1911-1994) was an American poet and writer
noted for her lyrical and symbolic poetry, creation of the new
twelve-tone form of poetry, founder of the international non-profit
organization Literary Olympics, Inc., and known as an author of
fiction, essays, reviews, translations, and as an editor. She is
not to be confused with the British poet (1924-2008) of the same
name. For more detailed information about her life, work, and
critical commendations, see the Wikipedia article
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Bartlett_%28American_poet%29">
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Bartlett_%28American_poet%29</a>.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Bartlett's most notable achievements include:
</p>

<p class="noindent">
* Creation of a new form of poetry, "the twelve-tone poem,"
adapting Arnold Schoenberg's musical system to the verbal, accented
sounds of language. Called "the Emily Dickinson of the 20th
Century," her concise lyrics have been praised by poets, musicians,
and composers alike.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
* Publication of 16 books of poetry, a group of edited anthologies,
and more than 1,000 poems, short stories, and essays published, for
example, in <i>Harper's</i>, <i>Virginia Quarterly</i>, <i>New York Times</i>,
<i>North American Review</i>, <i>Saturday Review</i>, <i>Prairie Schooner</i>,
and in numerous international collections.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
* Recipient of many fellowships, grants and awards, including NEA,
PEN Syndicate, fellowships at the Huntington Hartford Foundation,
Montalvo, Yaddo, MacDowell, Dorland Mt. Colony and Ragdale, travel
grants, and honors for introducing literature as part of the
Olympics.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
* Founder of the Literary Olympics, to restore literature,
specifically poetry, as a vital part of the Olympics as it once
had been in ancient Greece.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Bartlett's poetry came to the attention of leading poets, writers,
and critics as diverse as Marianne Moore, Wallace Stevens, Mark
Van Doren, Conrad Aiken, Allen Tate, Alfred Kreymborg, Robert
Hillyer, Louis Untermeyer, Rolfe Humphries, John Ciardi, Richard
Eberhart, Richard Wilbur, Maxine Kumin, Robert M. Hutchins,
Kenneth Rexroth, William Stafford, and others. Over the years,
Bartlett maintained an active and extensive correspondence with
eminent poets, writers, and literary critics; evident throughout
this collected literary correspondence are strong statements
attesting to the importance of her work. Extensive permanent
collections of Elizabeth Bartlett's papers, literary correspondence,
publications, unpublished manuscripts, and art have been
established, one as part of the Archive for New Poetry maintained
by the Mandeville Department of Special Collections at the
University of California, San Diego, and the second by the Rare
Books Collection of the University of Louisville. Bartlett's
readings of her poetry have been recorded for the Library of
Congress, Yale, Harvard, Stanford, and other collections.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Bartlett's twelve-tone form of poetry was introduced in her book,
<i>Twelve-Tone Poems</i>, published in 1968. In Bartlett's words: "The
12-tone poem is a new form.... It was inspired by Arnold
Schoenberg's musical system. The poem consists of 12 lines,
divided into couplets. Each couplet contains 12 syllables, using
the natural cadence of speech. The accented sounds of the words
are considered tones. Only 12 tones are used throughout the poem,
repeated various times. As a result, the poem achieves a rare
harmony that is purely lyrical, enriching its imagery and meaning."
</p>

<p class="noindent">
About this work, Allen Tate wrote: "The new form is most
interesting, the poems quite beautiful and distinguished."
Encouraged by this and other commendatory responses to her
twelve-tone poems by poets, musicians, and composers including
Stephen Sondheim, Bartlett continued to develop the new form.
<i>The House of Sleep</i>, published in 1975, was the result, consisting
of 62 poems related to dreams and written in the new form. Of these
poems, William Stafford wrote: "There is a trancelike progression
in these poems, in which all unfolds quietly, with a steady holding
of a certain pervasive tone." Robert M. Hutchins wrote: "I am much
impressed. The poems seem to me what is called an important
contribution, and a beautiful one."
</p>

<p class="noindent">
A third collection of twelve-tone poems, <i>In Search of Identity</i>,
was published in 1977, further establishing the diversity and
versatility of ways in which Bartlett was able to make use of the
new form. A fourth collection of twelve-tone poems was published
in 1981, <i>Memory Is No Stranger</i>.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Her husband, Paul Alexander Bartlett (1909  1990) was an American
writer, artist, and poet. He made a large-scale study of more than
350 Mexican haciendas, published novels, short stories, and poetry,
and worked as a fine artist in a variety of media. For more
detailed information about his life and work, see the Wikipedia

psychologist and philosopher who has many published books and
articles in the fields of philosophy and psychology. For more

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
